# Homebrew formula for the RideFollow terminal client.
#
# This is the seed/source-of-truth copy. The publish workflow
# (.github/workflows/publish-cli.yml) bumps `url` + `sha256` on every release
# and pushes the result to the Homebrew tap so `brew upgrade` just works.
#
#   brew install ridefollow/tap/ridefollow-cli      # once the tap is published
#
# Or straight from this file, without a tap:
#   brew install --formula ./cli/Formula/ridefollow-cli.rb
